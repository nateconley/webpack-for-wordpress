# 2. Loaders

Webpack are one part of what makes webpack so useful and powerful. Loaders are used to do all sorts of magic with different filetypes, and the testing of filenames gives you even more fine-grained control.

As per the Babel docs, https://babeljs.io/ , we will install ```babel-cli``` and ```babel-preset-env```. In addition to this, we need to install a webpack loader, ```babel-loader```.
